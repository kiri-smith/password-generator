# password-generator

For this project, I modified existing html, css, and javascript code to create a Password Generator. When the user clicks "Generate Password" they are prompted to answer a series of qualifiers for the password specifics.  The created code then stores their input and will use it to generate a random password that fulfills their requests.  I used Git to commit and push my changes and GitHub to house the repository where I then deployed the completed project.
